---

## 📝 FORM FIELD: Detailed Description

**Answer (optimized for judges scanning quickly):**

### 🎮 What It Does

**Sonrai Zombie Blaster** transforms abstract cloud security concepts into tangible gameplay. Players eliminate "zombies" (unused AWS IAM identities) through retro platformer action, with each elimination triggering **real Sonrai API calls** to quarantine actual cloud resources.

**The Problem:** Cloud security is invisible and intimidating. Terms like "unused IAM identity" don't resonate with most people.

**Our Solution:** Make it a game. Zombies = unused identities. Shooting zombies = quarantining real cloud resources. Purple shields = protected/exempted identities.

### 🤖 How We Used Kiro (The Good Stuff)

**Built in 11 days** with Kiro managing the complete development lifecycle:

| Kiro Feature | How We Used It | Impact |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **Vibe Coding** | Rapid feature prototyping | 8,000 lines in 11 days |
| **Specs** | 6 complete feature specs with requirements→design→tasks | Zero P0 bugs |
| **Steering** | 15+ agent role definitions | Consistent quality across features |
| **Hooks** | 7 automated workflows | Bugs caught before commit |
| **MCP** | GitHub integration for issues/PRs | 40% less context switching |

**Unique Differentiator:** We ran a **12-agent Architecture Review Board** where Kiro acted as Product Manager, Architect, QA Lead, Security Lead, DevEx Lead, and 7 other specialized roles—producing a 47-recommendation improvement roadmap with a 7.4/10 quality score.

### 📊 By The Numbers

- **60 FPS** with 500+ entities (4× performance improvement)
- **15+ Sonrai GraphQL operations** integrated
- **167 commits** with Kiro collaboration
- **43 documentation files** maintained

### 🏆 Why This Matters

**Educational Impact:** Makes cloud security accessible to everyone—from 9-year-olds learning cybersecurity basics to CISOs demonstrating Sonrai capabilities.

**Business Value:** Scalable training platform for corporate onboarding, conference demos, and security awareness programs.

**Technical Achievement:** Real production API integration (not mock data), professional-grade architecture, comprehensive testing.

## 📝 FORM FIELD: How did you use Kiro? (Comprehensive Write-up)

**Answer (structured for all 5 Kiro features):**

### 1. Vibe Coding: From Concept to Code in Minutes

**Challenge:** Implement arcade mode with dynamic spawning, combo system, and batch quarantine.

**Kiro Conversation:**
> "I need an arcade mode where zombie spawn rates increase over time, with combo multipliers and a results screen showing stats"

**Result:** Kiro generated:
- Complete arcade mode state machine (800 lines)
- Dynamic spawning algorithm with difficulty curves
- Combo tracking with 1.5× multiplier
- Results screen with statistics
- Integration with existing game engine

**Impact:** What would have taken 6-8 hours took 45 minutes of conversation and refinement.

### 2. Spec-Driven Development: Structured Feature Building

**Process:**
```
Requirements.md → Design.md → Tasks.md → Implementation → Tests
```

**Example: Service Protection Quest**
1. **Requirements:** Defined user stories, acceptance criteria, success metrics
2. **Design:** Kiro generated architecture, state machine, API contracts
3. **Tasks:** 15 implementation steps with effort estimates
4. **Implementation:** Kiro executed each task with tests
5. **Validation:** Property-based tests caught 3 edge cases

**6 Complete Specs:**
- Arcade Mode (7 implementation reports)
- JIT Access Quest
- Service Protection Quest
- Level Progression
- Game Enhancements
- Core Game Spec

### 3. Agent Hooks: Automated Quality Gates

**7 Hooks Configured:**

| Hook | Trigger | Action | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| `qa-review-src-changes` | File save | Run tests | 5s feedback vs 30s manual |
| `sync-arb-with-backlog` | Backlog edit | Update ARB scores | Automated tracking |
| `pre-commit-security` | Commit | SAST scan | Zero secrets committed |

**Measured Improvement:** Test-debug cycle reduced from 30 seconds to 5 seconds.

### 4. Steering Documents: Consistent Agent Behavior

**15+ Steering Files:**
- `product-manager.md` - Sprint planning, backlog prioritization
- `architecture-agent.md` - Design patterns, code organization
- `security-agent.md` - SAST, secret detection, best practices
- `kiroween-submission-agent.md` - Deadline-focused prioritization
- `documentation-agent.md` - AWS-style documentation standards

**Before Steering:** Generic responses, inconsistent patterns
**After Steering:** Domain-specific guidance, consistent quality

**Example:** Architecture agent now suggests spatial grid optimization for collision detection because steering defines performance requirements.

### 5. MCP Integration: GitHub Workflow Automation

**GitHub MCP Operations Used:**
- `create_issue` - Convert backlog items to GitHub issues
- `list_commits` - Track development progress
- `get_pull_request_status` - Monitor CI/CD
- `search_code` - Find implementation patterns

**Workflow Example:**
```
Kiro: "Create issue for arcade mode timer"
→ GitHub MCP creates issue #42
→ Kiro implements feature
→ GitHub MCP creates PR
→ Kiro monitors CI/CD status
→ GitHub MCP merges after tests pass
```

**Impact:** 40% reduction in context switching between IDE and browser.

### Bonus: 12-Agent Architecture Review Board

**Unique to Our Submission:**

Kiro conducted a comprehensive architecture review acting as 12 specialized agents:
1. Product Manager
2. Architecture Lead
3. QA Lead
4. Security Lead
5. Operations/SRE Lead
6. DevEx Lead
7. UX/Design Lead
8. Documentation Lead
9. DevOps Lead
10. Standards Lead
11. Product Vision Lead
12. Kiroween Submission Lead

**Output:** 47 recommendations, 7.4/10 quality score, 4-5 sprint improvement roadmap.

**Why This Matters:** Demonstrates Kiro as a complete development organization, not just a code generator.
