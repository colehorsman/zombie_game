## Recording Tips

1. **Pre-record gameplay** - Don't try to play live while talking
2. **Use keyboard shortcuts** - Smoother than mouse for demo
3. **Keep energy up** - 3 minutes goes fast
4. **Edit tight** - Cut any dead air or mistakes
5. **Add captions** - Accessibility + judges watching on mute
