# Product Overview

**Sonrai Zombie Blaster** is an educational video game that makes cloud security accessible to everyone—from 9-year-olds to CISOs. Through retro-style gameplay, players learn critical security concepts while triggering real remediation actions via Sonrai's Cloud Permissions Firewall.

## Mission Alignment with Sonrai Security

**Sonrai's Core Message:** "Secure your cloud with intelligent identity and data protection"

**Game's Educational Mission:**
- **Visibility** - Visualize unused identities as zombies, making the invisible visible
- **Control** - Demonstrate least privilege through purple shields and JIT access
- **Automation** - Show real-time API integration with actual quarantine actions
- **Intelligence** - Teach WHY security matters through contextual education

## Core Concept

**The Problem We're Solving:**
Cloud security is abstract and intimidating. Terms like "unused IAM identity" and "third-party access" don't resonate with most people. This game transforms complex security concepts into tangible, understandable gameplay.

**How It Works:**
- **Zombies** = Unused AWS identities (contractor accounts, old service roles, forgotten users)
- **Eliminating zombies** = Real Sonrai API calls that quarantine identities
- **Third-party entities** = External services with access to your cloud
- **Purple shields** = Protected/exempted identities (Sonrai, approved accounts, JIT-protected roles)
- **Quests** = Real security scenarios (service protection, JIT access, compliance)

**Educational Value:**
Every game mechanic teaches a security concept. Players learn by doing, not by reading documentation.
