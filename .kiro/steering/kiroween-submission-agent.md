## Kiro Usage Documentation

### Required: Comprehensive Write-up

Judges need to understand HOW we used Kiro. Document:

#### 1. Vibe Coding Examples

**What to Document:**

- Debugging sessions where Kiro identified issues
- Refactoring conversations

**Evidence to Collect:**
- Chat transcripts showing feature development
- Before/after code comparisons
- Screenshots of Kiro generating complex logic
- Metrics: lines of code generated, time saved

**Example Write-up:**
```markdown
### Vibe Coding: From Concept to Code

**Challenge:** Implement a complex arcade mode with dynamic difficulty scaling

**Kiro Conversation:**
"I need an arcade mode where zombie spawn rates increase over time,
with combo multipliers and a results screen showing stats"

**Result:** Kiro generated:
- Complete arcade mode state machine (150 lines)
- Dynamic spawning algorithm with difficulty curves
- Combo tracking system with visual feedback
- Results screen with statistics
- Integration with existing game engine

**Impact:** What would have taken 6-8 hours of implementation took 45 minutes
of conversation and refinement with Kiro.
```

#### 2. Spec-Driven Development

**What to Document:**
- Which features used specs
- Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow
- How specs improved code quality
- Comparison to vibe coding approach

**Evidence to Collect:**
- Spec files in .kiro/specs/
- Task completion tracking
- Property-based tests generated from specs
- Architecture decisions documented

**Example Write-up:**
```markdown
### Spec-Driven Development: JIT Access Quest

**Approach:** Used Kiro's spec workflow for complex quest system

**Process:**
1. Requirements gathering: Defined user stories and acceptance criteria
2. Design phase: Kiro helped design state machine and API integration
3. Task breakdown: Generated 15 implementation tasks
4. Execution: Kiro implemented each task with tests

**Comparison to Vibe Coding:**
- Vibe: Fast for simple features, can miss edge cases
- Spec: Slower upfront, but comprehensive and testable
- Result: Spec approach caught 3 bugs before implementation

**Impact:** Spec-driven development ensured quest system was robust
and maintainable, with 95% test coverage.
```

- Result: Immediate feedback on code changes

**Impact:**
- Reduced test-debug cycle from 30s to 5s
- Caught 12 bugs before commit
- Improved developer confidence

**Other Hooks:**
- "Update Docs on Feature Complete" - Auto-updates README
- "Security Scan on Commit" - Runs SAST before push
```

#### 4. Steering Documents

**What to Document:**

#### In Kiro Usage Write-up:

```markdown
### Multi-Agent Architecture Review

**Challenge:** Ensure production-ready code quality across all dimensions

**Kiro Approach:** Assembled 11 specialized agents to conduct comprehensive review

**Process:**
1. Each agent reviewed codebase from their domain perspective
2. Agents identified strengths and improvement areas
3. Generated 43 specific recommendations with estimates
4. Created 4-5 sprint roadmap for improvements

**Result:**
- 7.5/10 overall assessment with clear improvement path
