## 🎯 Current State Assessment

### Strengths ✅
- **Real API Integration** - Not a simulation, actual Sonrai operations
- **Retro Aesthetic** - Approachable, nostalgic, reduces intimidation
- **Dual-Mode Gameplay** - Variety keeps players engaged
- **Visual Metaphors** - Zombies = unused identities (intuitive)

### Gaps ❌
- **No Context** - Players don't understand WHY zombies are dangerous
- **Missing Explanations** - Terms like "IAM", "JIT", "quarantine" unexplained
- **No Learning Path** - Jump straight into gameplay without foundation
- **Limited Educational Value** - Fun to play, but what do players learn?

## 🎓 The 9-Year-Old Test

**Question:** Can a 9-year-old explain cloud security concepts after playing?

### Current State ❌
- "It's a zombie game where you shoot stuff"
- No understanding of what zombies represent
- No connection to real-world security

### With Enhancements ✅
- "Zombies are old accounts that hackers can steal"
- "Purple shields protect the good stuff"
- "We clean up accounts so bad guys can't break in"
- "Third-parties are like visitors - some are good, some are risky"
