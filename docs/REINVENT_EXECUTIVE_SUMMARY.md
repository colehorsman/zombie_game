# re:Invent Demo - Executive Summary

**Event:** AWS re:Invent 2025  
**Timeline:** 1 week to implement  
**Target:** AWS Practitioners (Cloud Engineers, Architects, DevOps, Security)  
**Goal:** Memorable demo that drives Sonrai booth traffic and leads

---

## 🎯 The Strategy

### The Problem
Conference attendees have 3-5 minutes at a booth. Current game is fun but doesn't clearly communicate:
- What Sonrai does
- Why it matters
- How it works
- What to do next

### The Solution
Add 3 critical features that transform the game from "fun" to "educational":

1. **Tooltips** - Context for every entity (zombies, third-parties, shields)
2. **Stats Dashboard** - Show real-world impact after gameplay
3. **Demo Mode** - Make API calls visible and educational

### The Impact
**Before:** "That was a fun zombie game"  
**After:** "Holy sh*t, I just quarantined 23 real identities in 3 minutes. We need Sonrai."

---

## 📋 What We're Building

### Feature 1: Contextual Tooltips
**What:** Hover over any entity to see details  
**Why:** Educates without interrupting gameplay  
**Example:**
```
Hover over zombie →
"contractor-john - Unused 180 days
Risk: CRITICAL
Action: Quarantine via Sonrai"
```

### Feature 2: Stats Dashboard
**What:** Post-game screen showing impact  
**Why:** Connects gameplay to real-world value  
**Example:**
```
You cleaned: 23 identities
Time saved: 4 hours
Risk reduced: 37%
Cost avoided: $847K
→ [Schedule Demo] [Start Trial]
```

### Feature 3: Demo Mode
**What:** Visual API call overlay  
**Why:** Shows this is real, not a simulation  
**Example:**
```
Eliminate zombie →
"Calling Sonrai API...
ChangeQuarantineStatus
✅ SUCCESS - Identity quarantined"
```

## ⏱️ Timeline

### 7-Day Sprint
- **Day 1-2:** Tooltips (12 hours)
- **Day 3-4:** Stats Dashboard (12 hours)
- **Day 5-6:** Demo Mode (8 hours)
- **Day 7:** Polish & Testing (8 hours)

**Total:** 40 hours of development

### Minimal Viable Demo (if time is tight)
Focus on just tooltips + stats dashboard = 24 hours = 3 days

## 🎪 Booth Experience

### The Flow
1. **Attract:** "Want to see YOUR AWS organization as a game?"
2. **Engage:** 3-5 minute gameplay with real data
3. **Educate:** Tooltips teach concepts during play
4. **Impact:** Stats dashboard shows what they accomplished
5. **Convert:** QR codes for demo, trial, download

### The Pitch
> "Every zombie is a REAL unused identity from your AWS accounts. Watch what happens when you eliminate one... [shoots] ...boom! That identity just got quarantined in your Sonrai tenant. This is real, not a demo."

### The "Aha!" Moments
1. "That's MY data!" - See their AWS account names
2. "Holy sh*t, that's real!" - See actual API calls
3. "We have HOW many?!" - See their zombie count
4. "This would take me hours!" - See time savings
5. "I need to show my team!" - Want to share
